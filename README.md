# MULTI-LINEAR-REGRESSTION-USING-OIL-CONSUMPTION-DATA
here are two files one is multi-linear regresstion model file and another is data file for the same model.

this program simply predicts your oil consumption based on other factors mentioned in dataset.

this is practice program for implementigng Linear regression with python. The python libraries used are Numpy, matplotlib pandas scikitlearn.

the data file contains data of petrol consumption with other factors.
